</h3>

#### 📢 ABOUT:
**Find the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub**

---
#### ⚠️ PROJECT:
*Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.*

*The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.*
